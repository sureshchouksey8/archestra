Connectors pull data from external tools into Knowledge Bases. A connector can be assigned to multiple Knowledge Bases. For direct document uploads, use [Knowledge Files](/docs/platform-knowledge-files) instead of creating a connector.

## Visibility

Each connector has a visibility setting that determines which users can retrieve its data when an agent calls `query_knowledge_sources`. Connectors and Knowledge Bases are filtered by visibility throughout the UI: users only see sources they have access to, and only those can be assigned to agents and MCP Gateways.

| Mode                      | Behavior                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Org-wide**              | All documents accessible to every user in the organization.                       |
| **Team-scoped**           | Documents accessible only to members of the assigned teams.                       |
| **Auto-sync permissions** | ACL entries synced from the source system (user emails, groups). Coming soon — see [#3218](https://github.com/archestra-ai/archestra/issues/3218). |

Users with the `knowledgeSource:admin` role can view and query every connector regardless of visibility.

> **Enterprise only.** Team-scoped visibility and auto-synced ACLs require an enterprise license. Contact [sales@archestra.ai](mailto:sales@archestra.ai) for licensing information.

When a multimodal embedding model is configured, image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) up to 4 MB are also indexed.

**Authentication:** an Azure AD app registration with client credentials (OAuth2). The app needs the `Sites.Read.All` application permission on Microsoft Graph, with admin consent granted.

| Field         | Description                                                                                       |

| Include Pages | Toggle to sync site pages and their web part content (default: on)                                |

Where to find each value:

- **Tenant ID** — **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > <your app> > Overview > Directory (tenant) ID**.
- **Client ID** — Application (client) ID on the same page.
- **Client Secret** — the secret **Value** from **Certificates & secrets** (not the secret ID).
- **Site URL** — the exact SharePoint site web URL, not the display name.

## OneDrive

Ingests files from OneDrive for Business (personal drives of specified users) via the Microsoft Graph API. Text is extracted from `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log` files, as well as `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` documents. When a multimodal embedding model is configured (e.g., `gemini-embedding-2-preview`), image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) up to 4 MB are also ingested and embedded directly.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant ID     | Your Azure AD (Entra ID) tenant ID or domain (e.g., `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)                        |

| Client Secret | Azure AD app registration client secret value                                                                        |
| User IDs      | Comma-separated list of user principal names or object IDs whose OneDrive to sync (e.g., `user@company.com`)       |
| Folder ID     | Restrict sync to a specific OneDrive folder (optional -- find the ID from the Graph API or a drive item URL)         |
| File Types    | Comma-separated file extensions to include, e.g. `.pdf, .docx` (optional -- leave blank for all supported types)  |
| Recursive     | Traverse subfolders within each user's drive (default: on)                                                          |

Authentication uses an Azure AD app registration with client credentials (OAuth2). The app registration requires the `Files.Read.All` application permission on Microsoft Graph, and admin consent must be granted.

To configure the connector:

- `Tenant ID` comes from **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > <your app> > Overview > Directory (tenant) ID**
- `Client ID` comes from **Application (client) ID** on the same page
- `Client Secret` is the secret **Value** from **Certificates & secrets**, not the secret ID
- `User IDs` should be user principal names (UPNs, e.g. `user@company.com`) or Azure AD object IDs for the users whose drives you want to sync

Incremental sync uses the `lastModifiedDateTime` field to fetch only items modified since the last run.

### Known Limitations

- Only OneDrive for Business (work/school accounts) is supported. Consumer OneDrive is not supported.
- Syncs the personal drive (`/drive`) of each specified user; shared libraries are not traversed.

## Google Drive

Sync files from Google Drive (My Drive and Shared Drives).

**Indexed:** files from My Drive and Shared Drives. Supported document types include `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx`. Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) are also indexed. When a multimodal embedding model is configured, image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are indexed too. Files larger than 10 MB are skipped.

**Authentication:** either a service account JSON key (recommended) or a short-lived OAuth2 access token with the `drive.readonly` scope. For a service account: create one in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the Google Drive API, download the JSON key, and share the target folders or drives with the service account email. Paste the full JSON contents (or the bearer token) into the **Service Account Key / OAuth Token** field.

## Salesforce

Sync CRM records from a Salesforce org.

**Indexed:** CRM records from a Salesforce org. By default the connector syncs `Account`, `Contact`, `Opportunity`, and `Case`. You can list other object API names in the **Objects** field, or use **Advanced Object Config JSON** to pick exact fields and associations per object.

**Authentication:** a Salesforce username, password, and security token. The password field must contain the password directly concatenated with the security token (no separator).

| Login URL                      | Salesforce login endpoint (default: `https://login.salesforce.com`; use `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandbox orgs) |
| Email                          | Your Salesforce username (e.g., `user@company.com`)                                                          |

| Advanced Object Config JSON    | Optional JSON for precise field and association control. Overrides the Objects field when provided.          |

Example advanced config:

```json
{
  "Lead": {
    "fields": ["FirstName", "LastName", "Company", "Email"],
    "associations": { "Account": ["Name"] }
  },
  "Case": {
    "fields": ["Subject", "Status", "Priority", "Description"]
  }
}
```

`Id`, `Name`, and `LastModifiedDate` are always included automatically.

## Managing Connectors

Connectors can be managed from either the **Connectors** page or a Knowledge Base's detail page. After creation you can:

- **Toggle enabled/disabled** -- suspends or resumes the cron schedule
- **Trigger sync** -- runs an immediate sync outside the schedule
- **View runs** -- see sync history with status, document counts, and errors

## Adding New Connector Types

See [Adding Knowledge Connectors](/docs/platform-adding-knowledge-connectors) for a developer guide on implementing new connector types.
